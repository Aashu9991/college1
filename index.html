      <h2>About Us</h2> <p>
        The city of Aurangabad with a glorious past was in deep slumber before the 
        late Honorable Dr. Rafiq Zakaria (Ex. Minister and Member of Parliament)
        discovered it. Among many other plans, he envisioned a centre of higher
        learning at the site of this legendary base of learning at Rauza Bagh,
        Aurangabad. Maulana Azad College of Arts, Science & Commerce is the first
        institution on the campus which was started in June 1963. The College is
        situated in the large and beautiful campus with its Mughal architecture and 
        beautifully laid gardens. Today there are two separate campuses running 
        seventeen educational institutions. The very first task that Dr. Rafiq Zakaria 
        faced, with his ebullient wife, Madam Fatma Rafiq Zakaria when they took up 
        the mission, was to ensure that the new buildings, would harmonize with the 
        old. Thus today we have a pleasing blend of medieval and modern structures 
        including an open-air auditorium with a futuristic dome embellished with 
        minarets, Darwazas, arches and mausoleums with their old-world charm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Rafiq Zakaria Today the Campus at its creative best, has over 10,000 
        boys and girls of diverse caste, class, creed and religion, learning 
        science & technology etc. Its hostels houses around 350 varied students 
        from all communities reflecting unity in cultural diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Rafiq Zakaria started the Maulana Azad College of Arts and Science in 
        1963 with the strength of just 144 students. Within a year, the Faculty 
        of Commerce was added and later, job-oriented courses in Geology, Industrial 
        Chemistry, Computer Application, Electronics and Microbiology were introduced. 
        At the Junior College level, job-oriented vocational courses were introduced 
        for the first time in the region. Today the College runs +2 level courses, 
        undergraduate programs of BA, B.Com, B.Com (e-commerce), B.Sc., B.Sc (Bio-tech), 
        BCA, BBA, MA and M.Sc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The college has a large and beautiful Naval Tata Stadium and the Millennium 
        Gymnasium & Sports Complex. There is a playground and large multi-gym with 
        modern equipment for sportsmen and sportswomen from the student and staff 
        community. There are four spacious canteens in the compound, a large parking 
        area with adequate security and gardens with flowering trees, herbs and 
        shrubs on the Campus.
  
  
      </p>
      <p>
        Maulana Azad College has become a first symbol of quality education as the 
        National Assessment & Accreditation Council (NAAC) has granted Grade 
        “A” (2004) which is re-acriditated in Sept. 2015 and the college is
        ISO 9001:2008 Certified College of the region. The College has the 
        distinction of being the first institution to have been accredited as 
        Grade "A" by NAAC. The college is selected by UGC for potential for 
        excellence from 2016. This makes the Maulana Azad College very proud 
        indeed and places on it great responsibility to carry forward a great 
        tradition established nearly five decades ago. This is the legacy that
        students will carry forward with them.
